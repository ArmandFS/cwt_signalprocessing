# cwt_signalprocessing
This repository was a final project on my biomedical engineering course "Non-Stationary Signal Analysis" Where I was given data for a PCG signal, and had to do all sorts of stuff with it, such as applying a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), the Shannon Envelope, and a Thresholding method.


PS. to see the output and graphs of the signal processing,  you can open this in google colab instead. Due to me using plotly, GIthub is unable to display it here in the repository.
