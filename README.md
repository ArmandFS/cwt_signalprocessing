# cwt_signalprocessing
This repository was a final project on my biomedical engineering course "Non-Stationary Signal Analysis" Where I was given data for a PCG signal, and had to do all sorts of stuff with it, such as applying a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), the Shannon Envelope, and some Thresholding.
